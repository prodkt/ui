## Prerequisites

Before installing Prodkt UI, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 18 or later
- A [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) project, version 18 or later
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) installed in your project

<Callout type="info">
  Prodkt UI currently only supports the CSS Variables version of shadcn/ui
</Callout>

## Installation

You can install Prodkt UI components using either the `prodkt-ui` or `shadcn` CLI e.g.

<Installer packageName="{package}" />

This will install the component into your project at `@/components/prodkt-ui/{package}` (or the relevant folder you specified in the `components.json` file).

## Usage

After installing a Prodkt UI component, you can start using it in your React application.

For example, check out the [Gantt Chart](/gantt) component.
